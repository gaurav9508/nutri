Overview:
NutifyX is a web application built using Flask that provides recommendations for crops and fertilizers based on soil nutrients and weather conditions. It also includes functionality for plant disease detection, although this part is commented out in the current code.

Features:
Crop Recommendation: Predicts the most suitable crop for a given soil composition and weather conditions.
Fertilizer Recommendation: Suggests appropriate fertilizer ratios based on the current soil nutrient content and crop type.
Weather Integration: Retrieves weather data (temperature and humidity) using the OpenWeatherMap API for accurate crop predictions.
Plant Disease Detection (commented out in the current code): Uses a deep learning model to classify and predict plant diseases from an uploaded image.
